# Intuitive Educational Examples from Copula Theory
This repository contains a few intuitive examples to illustrate core concepts from copula theory. Here's a short list of scripts and their respective purpose:
1. The script ´introToCopulas.R´ demonstrates how a Gaussian copula can be used to simulate two correlated random variables with arbitrary marginal distributions. It accomplishes this with basic R code and thus without the use of the copula package in order to demystify the concept.
2. a ´fhBounds.py´ is a short Python script that generates a 3D visualization of three basic copulas (countermonotonicity, independence, and comonotonicity) in a bivariate setting. The countermonotonicity copula constitutes the lower Fréchet-Hoeffding bound, while the comonotonicity copula is the upper Fréchet-Hoeffding bound. The independence copula lies between the two.
